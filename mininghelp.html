            <p>
              It’s quick and very easy! As soon as we receive your payment your
              contract will be added to your profile, and you can immediately
              start mining. Depending on the blockchain algorithm you select and
              the associated mining service agreement you enter into, you can
              either mine native cryptocurrencies directly or allocate your
              hashpower to other cryptocurrencies (marked with AUTO), and even
              choose a specific allocation for them. For example: 60% LTC, 20%
              BTC and 20% DOGE. The first mining output is released after 48
              hours, and then a daily mining output will follow.

              Besides the fact that we ourselves mine with the very same
              hardware that we offer to our clients, our capital is limited. We
              believe that Bitcoin and Altcoin mining is one of the best ways to
              receive Cryptocurrencies, however, we do not want to “put all our
              eggs in one basket”.

              For security reasons, we do not disclose the exact location of our
              mining farms. As of April 2015, we are operating several mining
              farms that are located in Europe, America and Asia. Electricity
              cost and availability of cooling are important, but not the only
              criteria. See our Datacenters page for more information.

            What coins I mine with each algorithm?

          <div class="copyfourth" id="copyfourth">
            <p>
              You are able to mine Bitcoin and various altcoins directly via our
              mining allocation page*. The availability of cryptocurrencies you
              can mine depends on the contract you have chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must allocate your hashpower in order to determine the
              cryptocurrency received for your mining output. If no allocation
              has been made, the mining output will default to the following for
              the given blockchain algorithm:
            </p>
            <p>
              SHA-256 contract - Bitcoin
              <br />
              Ethash contract - Ethereum
              <br />
              (*) “Timexsignals Advanced Allocation” (special feature): It
              allows you to get mining outputs in many different coins even if
              they are not mined directly by a certain algorithm. For example,
              you can get mining outputs in BTC while mining with an X11
              algorithm! That is possible by mining the DASH coin directly,
              which is then automatically swapped to BTC by our algorithmic
              framework. The Allocation function is designed for customers to
              receive delivery of their mining results in their preferred
              cryptocurrency. We call it “mining BTC the smart way”. The same
              technique is also used to get mining results in LTC with a SHA-256
              contract, etc.

            How do your ether contacts work?
          </button>
          <div class="copyfifth" id="copyfifth">
            <p>
              When you purchase an Ether mining contract, you buy a share of a
              GPU (“graphics processing unit“) to mine Ethereum. The hashing
              algorithm used to mine Ether is called Ethash (or
              Dagger-Hashimoto).
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethash requires the so called DAG file in order to perform the
              calculations. This file grows over time, which means that more
              operations for each hashing operation need to be performed. This
              means that the effective hashrate decreases a little each time the
              DAG file grows.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has to be considered when comparing the theoretical output of
              your hashpower. Online calculators do not take this into account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, please keep in mind that some of our products have a

            <p>
              Bitcoin and altcoin mining depends highly on the prices and
              network difficulties of the Cryptocurrencies that you are mining,
              which cannot be predicted. It would not “look right” if we would
              provide data on the mining performance and sell contracts at the
              same time. Therefore, we recommend all our clients to do their own
              research and do their own performance calculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, you might want to have a look at coinwarz.com.
              Remember that some of our products have a daily maintenance fee
              which must be deducted from the daily mining rewards.

            <p>
              We do not publish a list of pools we are using. Our main criteria
              for a good pool are: reliability, fee structure and reject rate.
              Going forward we will solo-mine a few coins (and pass the fee

            </p>
            <p>
              Our internal policy is: “be a good crypto citizen”. This means,
              that we will at least use two different pools (in some cases we
              use up to four) for each coin. This is to preserve the
              decentralized nature of the crypto networks! If we become aware
              that a pool is getting close to 50% share, we will switch away
              from it and use a backup instead.

            Isn't buying hardware cheaper?
          </button>
          <div class="copyeighth" id="copyeighth">
            <p>
              On the first glance one might think that buying miner X is
              slightly cheaper than hosted mining. However, there are a number
              of “hidden” costs related to purchasing and maintaining a miner
              that change the economics significantly:
            </p>
            <p>
              Shipping costs: few merchants will cover this, but in most cases
              they will charge you extra.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customs dues / VAT: if it is an international delivery you will
              likely have to pay customs dues and VAT; generally this has a huge
              impact on the total cost of your mining equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Delivery time: when you pay for your device you have to wait until
              the miner is packaged and shipped; if it is held up in the customs
              this can take weeks. And during that time you cannot mine at all
              (“opportunity costs”). You have to wait and hope. And if the
              merchant has a stock shortage; it is you who has to wait.
              WithTimexsignals you pay and get your hashpower immediately
              online. No delays!
            </p>
            <p>
              Costs for additional equipment: when buying miners from larger
              retailers you often have to buy additional equipment like an extra
              PSU that matches the electricity specs for your country, control
              units and specific shelves to store them efficiently. This adds up
              significantly to the overall price for hashpower.
            </p>
            <p>
              Setting the system up: when the device finally arrived you have to
              assemble and configure it. Beginners often underestimate the
              amount of work and technical knowledge that is needed to bring the
              device up and optimize its settings. People that used the first
              ASICs spend days and weeks on it. In monetary terms this costs you
              twice: (i) your time and (ii) lost mining opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maintenance: hardware failures, outages and crashes could lead to
              downtimes between seconds and weeks. If your unit breaks you have
              to return it and start from scratch (by the way: check the
              guarantee time of your miner; it is often less than a year). With
              Timexsignals you have a guaranteed uptime of 100%: in case one of
              your units fails another unit will be switched over and start
              mining for you the very same second.
            </p>
            <p>
              Electricity: having the machines at home not only brings heat and
              noise, but also an increase of your electricity bill; an important
              factor that many underestimate. Please do not get us wrong: we do
              not want to discourage anyone from mining at home! We are often
              asked about prices and realized that many users do not know about
              all the hidden costs. If you compare the true costs, you will
              notice that our prices are very competitive. We want to provide
              you the best possible mining experience, so that you can focus on
              mining your favorite coins (and we take care of the rest).

              Timexsignals allows its clients to mine different types of coins
              at the same time. You decide which coins you prefer and you can
              allocate hashpower accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each mining algorithm is set up with a default delivery
              cryptocurrency. The Timexsignals Advanced Auto-Allocation (in
              short “AUTO”) will apply to all cryptocurrencies which cannot be
              mined directly. In the user interface go to “Mining Allocation”
              and choose the hashpower allocation that is best for you. When you
              are done press “save allocation”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that the cryptocurrencies marked with (AUTO) are not
              directly mined, as mentioned in the “What coins can I mine?”
              section of this Customer Service page.

          <p>
            We do not control the market evolution and thus we cannot control
            the mining rewards. There are certain factors which may affect your
            outputs depending on the product you have purchased. This is the way
            your mining outputs will mostly vary: 1. It may happen that due to
            the lower mining output, the global interest in mining the natively
            mined coin of your contract diminishes. This would mean a decrease
            in the mining difficulty, which would also have a positive impact
            increasing your mining outputs. Conversely, if difficulty rises,
            your output will decrease. 2. If you change your allocation to any
            of the available AUTO coins (not natively mined), your mining
            outputs will be traded from the coin that is natively mined to the
            selected AUTO coin(s). Therefore, the exchange rate will affect your
            mining outputs. For any further questions regarding your contract,
            feel free to contact us via our web form or the “Contact Customer
            Service” section on your Timexsignals account.

            Since third-party calculators are a popular way of estimating mining
            performance, we have set up a Performance estimation tutorial on how
            to make your own calculations, along with the general explanation
            about potential mining scenarios. When evaluating the benefits,
            please keep in mind that mining, and using our service, is subject
            to a daily maintenance fee (if applicable to your mining plan) which
            must be deducted from the daily mining rewards. The results of
            cryptocurrency mining highly depend on the price and the network
            difficulties of the given cryptocurrencies that you are mining.
            Neither of those can be predicted, so each customer must make an
            independent decision about the benefits of cryptocurrency mining
            and, in doing so, should consider the risks and their own
            circumstance when choosing whether to mine.

          <p>
            Every algorithm can mine only certain cryptocurrencies directly:

            Zcash mines ZEC Scrypt mines LTC and DOGE CryptoNight-R mines XMR
            CryptoNightV0 mines XMC The other coins are marked with AUTO and
            they are not mined directly. In other words, mining outputs will be
            traded automatically from the mined coins to the AUTO ones at the
            exchange rate of that day.

            Your rank is based on the total amount your referrals have purchased

            rank, you’ll need to collect a total of $100 USD in referred sales.
            If you refer $50 USD in sales in the two weeks, then another $60 USD
            in the third week, your total amount purchased by your referrals
            will be $110 USD - so you’ll hit Rank 2 - Copper. Six weeks later,
            your referrals might purchase another $400 USD - your total would be
            $510 USD, and you’d hit Rank 3 - Bronze. Ranks are based over the
            last 100 days - that means they’re variable and your rank can
            ‘decay’ over time. Any referral’s purchase older than 100 days will
            be discarded, and your rank (and reward) adjusted accordingly.
            You’ll see your current rank and total sales performance on your

      <h3>What is CFD?</h3>
      <p>
        A CFD, or Contract for Difference, is a type of financial instrument
        that allows you to trade on the price movements of stocks, regardless of
        whether prices are rising or falling. The key advantage of a CFD is the
        opportunity to speculate on the price movements of an asset (upwards or
        downwards) without actually owning the underlying asset.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Stock trading has been a popular financial pursuit since stocks were
        first introduced by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century.
        This is both an efficient and effective type of investment for both
        families and individuals.
      </p>
      <h3>What are Stocks?</h3>
      <p>
        Stocks, also commonly referred to as equities or shares, are issued by a
        public corporation and put up for sale. Companies originally used stocks
        as a way of raising additional capital, and as a way to boost their
        business growth. When the company first puts these stocks up for sale,
        this is called the Initial Public Offering. Once this stage is complete,
        the shares themselves are then sold on the stock market, which is where
        any stock trading will occur.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        People occasionally confuse buying shares with physically owning a
        portion of that company as if this somehow gives them the right to walk
        into the company offices and begin exerting their ownership rights over
        computers or furniture. The law treats this type of corporation in a
        unique way; as it is treated as a legal person, the corporation,
        therefore, owns its own assets. This is referred to as the separation of
        ownership and control.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The separation of these things is beneficial to both the shareholders
        and the corporation because it limits the liability for each party. For
        example, if a major shareholder were to go bankrupt, they cannot then
        sell assets belonging to the corporation to cover their debts and pay
        their creditors. This is the same in reverse; if a corporation you own
        shares in goes bankrupt and the judge orders them to sell all their
        assets, none of your own personal assets are at risk.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        One thing lies at the core of a stock's value. It entitles shareholders
        to a portion of the company profits.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>How do I trade Stocks?</h3>
      <p>
        A stock market is where stocks are traded: where sellers and buyers come
        to agree on a price. Historically, stock exchanges existed in a physical
        location, and all transactions took place on the trading floor. One of
        the world’s most famous stock markets is the London Stock Exchange
        (LSE).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet as technology progresses, so does the stock market. Now we are
        seeing the rise of virtual stock exchanges that are made up of large
        computer networks will all trades performed electronically.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A company's shares can be traded on the stock market only following its
        IPO, making this a secondary market. The large businesses listed on
        global stock exchanges do not trade stocks on a frequent basis. Stocks
        can only be purchased from an existing shareholder, not directly from
        the company. This rule also applies in reverse, so when selling your
        shares, they go to another investor, not back to the corporation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The reason traders choose to invest in stock is because the perceived
        value of a company can vary greatly over time. Money can be made or
        lost; it depends on whether the trader’s perceptions of the stock value
        are in line with the market.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Trying to predict the price movements of stocks in the short term is
        nearly impossible. Generally, stocks do tend to appreciate in value in
        the long term, so many investors choose to have a diverse portfolio of
        stocks that they intend to keep for a long time. Bigger companies pay
        dividends to their shareholders, which is a portion of the company’s
        profits. The value of the share itself will not impact the dividend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In order to trade stocks, there must be a seller and a buyer; as not all
        traders have the same agenda, stocks are bought and sold at different
        times and for different reasons. Someone may sell their stock for
        profit, others sell it in order to cut losses, and some because they
        believe the value of the stock is about to change either way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Stock Trading Risk Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        All forms of financial investment carry a level of risk, and stock
        trading is no different. Even traders with decades of experience cannot
        predict the correct price movements every single time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        People use various strategies, but it is important to note that there is
        no such thing as a failsafe strategy. It is also advisable to limit the
        amount of money you invest in a single trade, as part of your own risk
        management.

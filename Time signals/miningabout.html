      <h2>Crypto Mining</h2>
      <span>Get to know a new idea of money</span>
    </div>
    <div></div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Why is mining so important?</h2>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency networks need computational power to run securely. The
          world’s most powerful blockchains are supported by millions of
          computers around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike paper money, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are produced
          mathematically and held digitally. The people who voluntarily offer
          their computing power to secure these cryptocurrency networks are
          called miners. Cryptocurrencies don’t have a central government or
          other so-called ‘middlemen’ that decide about the future of the
          system. – They are in fact digital, borderless democracies in which
          miners vote with their computing power to reach order and consensus.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How is bitcoin kept secure?</h2>
        <p>
          The only way to not create money out of thin air or corrupt it, is to
          burn real energy. This is called Proof-Of-Work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, bitcoin is the most secure computer network on the planet and
          it’s practically impossible to break it! The reason for that is hash
          power, the umbrella term used for the computing power that miners
          provide to the bitcoin network and similar cryptocurrency networks.
          Due to the rapid growth of the ecosystem, mining operations today are
          mostly running with specialized high-performance computers that
          function most efficiently set up in large data centers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What's the incentive for miners?</h2>
        <p>
          It all comes down to trust: Miners keep the blockchains trustworthy
          and are rewarded for their efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As miners, we are processing and verifying the transactions of the
          cryptocurrency ecosystems and keeping their public transaction history
          (blockchains) maintained and secure. For this, the mining community is
          rewarded with the networks’ transaction fees and newly created coins.
          It’s a win-win situation! When you start mining with us, you are
          getting your share of this reward.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>The big vision of cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>The future will be decentralized</p>
        <p>
          To keep the integrity (and values!) of all cryptocurrency ecosystems
          intact, miners keep the networks safe and its authority decentralized
          by keeping each other constantly in check. This allows both a healthy
          growth and a fair distribution of currency units to all
          crypto-citizens!
        </p>

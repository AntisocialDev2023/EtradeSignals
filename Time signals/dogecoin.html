      <h2>Dogecoin Mining</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Did you know that Dogecoin (DOGE) was intended as a joke? The creators
        made DOGE as a mechanism to enable users to tip each other for fun
        social media content. Despite the fact that DOGE set off on a whimsical
        foot, it’s become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to mining DOGE, the fastest and most profitable way to do
        so is using ASIC-driven hardware, a rig that uses application specific
        integrated circuits or ASICs. You also need to be a member of a DOGE
        mining pool. In short, you need three basic things in order to start
        mining Dogecoins:
      </p>
      <p>
        A mining rig, you are better off choosing ASIC hardware Your choice of
        Dogecoin mining pool – we will list some below The right software
        configuration Mining Dogecoin can be profitable There are a couple of
        reasons why mining Dogecoin instead of another coin is a good idea.
        First, transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain happen quickly so it
        means that DOGE mining pools tend to make payouts every 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over and above quick payouts, you can also rely on consistent revenue
        from Dogecoin. As a result, mining Dogecoin is efficient and profitable
        – and a good prospect. There are also plenty of markets where you can
        sell your Dogecoin which means that it is worth considering Dogecoin
        mining to generate a daily income for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        How to mine Dogecoin
        <br />
        DOGE is based on the Scrypt hashing algorithm and for that reason the
        best way to mine it is using something like the Antminer L3++ as this
        device makes use of ASICs. Furthermore, you should seriously consider
        joining a mining pool when mining DOGE coins because it is simply the
        best way to maximise profits.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does it mean to join a mining pool? It’s simple really: you add
        your mining power to a group of other people’s mining capabilities so
        that collectively you can achieve a higher hash rate – which means that
        it becomes quicker to solve the problems that lead to a crypto block
        award. In contrast, mining a single block on your own can take months or
        even years which means you will wait a very long time for any kind of
        reward, and you will have costs to cover in the meantime.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's required for mining DOGE
        <br />
        There’s a couple of things you need in place to mine Dogecoins. Your
        internet connection is the first, and we’ll suggest that you have
        uncapped usage on your connection, but make sure you have at least 0.5GB
        per day available. Next, you need a wallet to store your DOGE, you will
        also use this wallet to cash out your Dogecoins. DOGE has a free wallet
        which you can try, but many wallets support DOGE. So, the four things
        you need are:
      </p>
      <p>
        An ASIC miner as your mining rig
        <br />
        Internet that’s 24/7, always-on An estimate of how much power you will
        consume with your rig A trustworthy crypto wallet which can receive your
        Dogecoins Other important things you should think about Mining Dogecoins
        effectively and risk-free involve a couple of other complexities. Keep
        in mind that your mining rig will use a lot of power, so make sure your
        home or facility’s electrical power grid can support the power
        consumption of your mining rigs, particularly if you have several units.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because your rigs will work around the clock you should also account for
        heat build-up because these hardware units can generate a lot of heat.
        You need to cool your rigs so that you can make sure they keep on
        working 24/7 and to make sure mining performance stays at its maximum.
        Overheated machines can also be noisy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The planning guide to follow will explain what you need to do to deal
        with the potential power, heat and noise issues generated by ASIC mining
        rigs. One other thing: the lower your latency is on your internet
        connection, the better your mining rigs will perform – you’ll be able to
        notify the blockchain of a solved block faster, so a competing miner
        won’t accidentally beat you to claiming a solved block.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Best mining rig to buy
        <br />
        Recently, ASIC mining hardware was released which is able to mine coins
        using the Scrypt algorithm, that includes Dogecoin. Amongst your current
        options we think Bitmain Antminer L3++ is really your best option
        because it offers a good balance between electricity consumption and
        hashing power – and of course, price. In comparison the BW L21 has a low
        hash rate and also uses less power but the price is far higher for this
        ASIC rig.
      </p>
      <p>
        Configuring your ASIC hardware and software
        <br />
        Because you are mining DOGE with an ASIC rig you don’t need to worry
        about tricky software downloads and configuration anymore. ASICs come
        with pre-configured software pre-installed which means you are ready to
        get going by doing some basic configuration. Here are the steps:
      </p>
      <p>
        Connect your ASIC rig to the internet and supply electricity
        <br />
        Connect your ASIC to your power supply of choice. It’s easy to do this
        but do make sure you plug in every connector, you also need to plug your
        power supply into your power grid, of course. Don’t forget to plug the
        LAN cable in too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chosse the Dogecoin mining pool that suits you best
        <br />
        You should have a look at the popular DOGE mining pools and weigh up how
        these pay out rewards, what the fees are for mining and also make sure
        the payment method suits you. Some of the best pools include Aikapool,
        BlockMasters and Multipool. Once you’ve picked a pool you can go to the
        mining pool webpage and create workers, if the pool requires it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determine the IP
        <br />
        One way to find the IP address for your mining rig is to access your
        router – look in the DHCP list and find the associated host which might
        be Antminer, for example. Note the associated IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, download the rig’s IP reporter tool to your computer,
        this should show you a window where you can trigger a search – in turn,
        the tool will report what the IP address of your mining rig is. Of
        course, this method will only work if your mining rig is on your local
        network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access your mining rig via it's web interface
        <br />
        To access your mining rig, simply enter its IP address into your web
        browser. You should get a dialog box which allows you to log in, usually
        the credentials are simply root/root. But, you can check the manual
        shipping with the rig for the default credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supply your mining pool's details
        <br />
        When you’ve accessed your rig you can open the settings menu so that you
        can add the mining pools you want to contribute to. Make sure you supply
        complete details so that you can ensure your mining is never halted.
      </p>
      <span>You need to enter:</span>
      <p>
        The URL – for example, stratum+tcp://aikapool.com:3433 Worker –
        MyDOGEWalletAddress Password – -p c=DOGEPASS,mc=DOGEPASS If you don’t
        set out the payout coin you risk a payment getting sent via the
        incorrect cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Save your configuration Make sure to click save + apply to fix your
        configuration. It is also worth checking into the status of your miner
        after a while, see if you can find a hashrate – this indicates that your
        ASIC is performing and actively mining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mining DOGE in the cloud
        <br />
        Like other cryptocurrency, you can mine DOGE using a cloud platform,
        which could be attractive to you if you don’t want to faff with anything
        technical, prefer not to make an initial investment or simply don’t want
        to risk the electricity bills. When you use cloud mining you are
        basically asking a third party to do all the work, in exchange for a
        payment. So, always check the fees involved with cloud mining and
        compare it to your mining profits.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might find some cloud mining vendors offer a couple of months of
        free mining. However always make sure you are completely aware of all
        terms and conditions. Timexsignals can be a good option here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calculating Dogecoin profits
        <br />
        You always need to check your potential earnings before you start to
        mine, but you can use our simple calculator. All you need to do is to
        fill out the power consumption of your ASIC rig, the rate at which it
        hashes, electricity prices in your region – and the fee charged by your
        mining pool. Tap calculate to see your results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, to just see the pure sum of money you can make, only
        complete the pool fee and the hash rate. Note that, if you choose to use
        cloud mining, there will be a fee involved that is a part of your cloud
        mining contract so you need to make sure that the income you generate
        from mining will cover the price you pay for your cloud mining contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that the results below will vary depending on a range of
        factors which will change all the time – from block reward, to the value
        of DOGE and of course the overall network difficulty. We can show you an
        estimate for today, but the results for tomorrow would be very
        different.
      </p>

        Common Questions about Dogecoin
        <br />
        How long will it take to mine one DOGE?
      </p>
      <p>
        It depends on your mining hardware, but by example the BW L21 can hash
        at 550 megahashes per second, which means you can mine one DOGE in less
        than an hour.
      </p>
      <p>What's the maximum i can mine in a day?</p>
      <p>
        Use our calculator above to work out the value of the coins you can mine
        in a day, it will provide you with an approximation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should I mine DOGE?
        <br />
        Well, work out if the money that you get from selling the DOGE you earn
        will cover the costs of mining it – if so, you should consider mining
        Dogecoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a fixed supply of DOGE?
        <br />
        Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, there is no limit to the supply of
        Dogecoins – as such you can’t estimate when the very last DOGE will be
        mined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is DOGE mining legal?
        <br />
        For the most part, yes – many countries ranging from Canada and the US
        through to Russia are completely open to cryptocurrency but some
        countries including Morocco, Algeria, Bolivia and Nepal will have limits
        on both mining and trading of cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        More about Dogecoin
        <br />
        Billy Markus (from Portland in Oregon) created a coin which he hoped
        will be fun and easy to access. Since then, Dogecoin (DOGE) has achieved
        a big market cap. Around the same time someone called Jackson Palmer was
        asked by student on Twitter to make the idea popular. Jackson used to
        work for Adobe Systems in Australia, but as a side project decided to
        buy the domain dogecoin.com, adding some basic website elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Markus heard about it and the two decided to push Dogecoin, which was
        derived from Luckycoin – on its own a version of something called
        Litecoin. Dogecoin is based on the Scrypt algorithm and DOGE was
        released on the 6th of December in 2013, quickly becoming a sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dogecoin is a fun project – from the whimsical plans behind the coin
        through to its mascot, a Shiba Inu. It’s no wonder it has become a
        sensation on the internet – and it also brings solid opportunities to
        make profits by mining it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team behind DOGE
        <br />
        Jackson Palmer and Billy Marcus worked together to launch Dogecoin, but
        the credit for creating DOGE is given to Billy Marcus. Over time the
        DOGE team is trying to make Dogecoins even more accessible and even more
        fun – the idea is to make it more widespread than Bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a close community and you can easily get your questions answered
        by getting in touch with the DOGE team. Dogecoin’s team is also know for
        raising funds for good causes, including the Dogecoin Foundation – it’s
        intended to get people to use Dogecoin for charity causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOGE hashing algorithm
        <br />
        Litecoin and Dogecoin uses the same algorithm for hashing – it is called
        Scrypt, a result of the SHA-256 hard fork of BTC. Appearances are the
        Scrypt is in fact both more efficient and also works more quickly than
        the BTC hashing algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mining block time for DOGE is just about one minute, while the
        network difficulty is much less than it is for Litecoin – which is 2.5
        minutes block time – and of course 10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, when you mine DOGE you can do it at the same time as
        mining Litecoin. Litecoin is arguably more stable and has a bigger role
        in the cryptocurrency market than DOGE, so you hedge your bets, in
        effect. Mining DOGE and LTC simultaneously can maximise your mining
        income.
      </p>
      <p>
        DOGE forks
        <br />
        It is likely that DOGE will incur a hard fork sometime soon. A new
        project on Ethereum called Rinkeby will be using DOGE as a test asset –
        it’s cause a lot of chatter in the cryptocurrency sphere. The
        expectations is that something called Dogethereum (DOGX) is going to
        separate from DOGE’s original chain at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
        There has never been a hard fork of DOGE, this will be the first one and
        the plan is to make an alternative cryptocurrency which will be even
        faster than DOGE for processing transactions, while also making use of
        smart contracts which runs on Ethereum’s blockchain. Users of DOGE and
        investors in DOGE are rethinking the value of DOGE as a result.

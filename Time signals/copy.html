        It’s all in the name! Copy trading allows you to directly copy the
        positions taken by another trader. You decide the amount you wish to
        invest and simply copy everything they do automatically in real-time –
        when that trader makes a trade, your account will make that same trade
        as well. You do not need to have any input on the trades, and you get
        the identical returns on each trade as your chosen trader. But by
        copying another trader, you could potentially make money based on their
        skills. In fact, no advanced knowledge of the financial market is
        required to take part!
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of copy trading goes back to 2005 when traders used to copy
        specific algorithms that were developed through automated trading.
        Brokers recognised the potential of having systems where any linked to
        that trader could automatically copy their trading account. There was no
        need to constantly monitor email signals or trading ‘chat’ rooms. We
        think they were onto something. Out of this were born services that
        allowed traders to connect their personal trading accounts to their
        platform. Traders no longer had to submit their specific strategies. The
        popularity of copy trading has since exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 in 3 say a traditional stock market approach is over-complex and this
        can be simplified by automatically following traders. 1 in 4 investors
        said they were considering Copy trading last year
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select an
        expert or experts that you want to copy trades from. Once you are signed
        up, this is the only action needed on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no codes
        that you need to run or signals for you to manually input. Our software
        will handle the trade copying automatically on your behalf. We monitor
        your experts trading activity and as soon as there is a trade, we
        calculate all the necessary parameters and execute the trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough funds
        available in your trading account. When the expert exits a position, you
        too will exit it. Automatically.

              We carefully select expert applicants. We get to know them as a
              trader and examine their trading performance over a period of
              time. We also tend to look for expert who already have a following
              to further confirm their competence (social proof). You can also
              read about every expert on their individual performance pages.

              We suggest to have around $3000-$5000 in your account due to

              cover the trading cost every month.

            How does this work?

          <div class="copythird" id="copythird">
            <p>
              Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select
              an expert or experts that you want to copy trades from. Once you
              are signed up, this is the only action needed on your part.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once you’ve taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no
              codes that you need to run or signals for you to manually input.
              Our software will handle the trade copying automatically on your
              behalf. We monitor your experts trading activity and as soon as
              there is a trade, we calculate all the necessary parameters and
              execute the trade.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The copier works based on trade percent amount. So, for example,
              if your expert takes a position in XYZ coin for a total of 10% of
              his account value and you are 100% allocated to that expert, then
              the copier will also execute a trade in your account in the amount
              of 10% of your account value.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough
              available base currency that your expert trades with, in your
              trading account. How much is enough? First, you must meet the
              exchanges minimum order amount (let’s say about $10 per trade to
              be safe). That means that if your expert executes a 5% order, you
              must have at least $300 in your account total value (at 100%
              expert allocation as an example). This also means that you need to
              have at least 10% or higher in available base currency to avoid
              missed trades.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it.
              Automatically. You can also change allocation at any time.
